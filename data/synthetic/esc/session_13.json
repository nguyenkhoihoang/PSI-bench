I have been feeling like an impostor, especially when I have to do in-person interviews, and it's making me very nervous. I also tend to blame myself a lot when things don't go well, and it feels overwhelming sometimes. I want to understand why I feel this way and how I can manage these emotions better."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "When I start feeling like an impostor during interviews, my mind races with thoughts like, \"I'm not good enough,\" or \"They'll realize I don't belong here.\" I get this tight feeling in my chest, and sometimes my hands shake a little. I also start to think that if I mess up, it's all my fault because I didn't prepare enough or I'm not smart enough. These thoughts make it really hard to focus, and I end up feeling really anxious and overwhelmed."

How do you think acknowledging these feelings might change your experience during interviews?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I wish I could tell myself that it's okay to feel nervous and that everyone makes mistakes, especially in interviews. I want to remind myself that I do have the skills and knowledge because I worked hard to get my degree. Acknowledging these feelings might help me slow down and breathe instead of letting the anxiety take over. Maybe if I accept that it's normal to feel this way, I could focus more on what I'm saying rather than on my fears."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I imagine it would feel comforting, like giving myself permission to be human and not perfect. It might help ease some of the tightness in my chest and slow down my racing thoughts. But I also worry that when anxiety really spikes, I might forget to be kind to myself and fall back into old patterns. What might help me remember these reminders is maybe writing them down somewhere I can see before the interview or practicing some calming techniques like deep breathing right before I go in. Having a small mantra or phrase to repeat could also be useful to bring me back to a calmer state."

Maybe something like, \"I am prepared, and I am enough,\" or \"It's okay to be nervous; I can handle this.\" I want a phrase that reminds me to stay grounded and that feeling anxious doesn't mean I'm failing. Practicing these in everyday moments, like when I'm at home or talking with friends, could help me remember to use them during the interviews."

It might also help to pair journaling with other supportive activities, like talking to my spouse or a trusted friend who understands what I’m going through.

I think combining that with a calming activity, like a short walk or some deep breathing, would help me reset physically and emotionally. To stay connected to my sense of self-compassion when anxiety feels intense, I might keep a list of my mantras or kind reminders somewhere visible, like on my phone or a sticky note, so I can easily access them.

It also feels comforting to connect with a close friend who listens without judgment. Sometimes, just knowing that someone else understands and cares can make a big difference. I might set a plan to check in with them regularly or send a quick message when I’m feeling overwhelmed.
