      "content": "I've been feeling really anxious about my job interviews lately. Even though I studied hard and have the right degree, I keep feeling like I'm not good enough or like I'll be found out as a fraud. It's making it hard for me to stay calm and confident during interviews."
    },

      "content": "It sounds like these feelings of not being good enough are quite powerful and are affecting how you experience your interviews. Can you tell me more about when these thoughts of being a fraud tend to come up for you? What do you notice in your body or mind at those moments?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Those thoughts usually hit me right before the interview starts or when I'm asked a question I don't immediately know how to answer. My heart races, my hands get sweaty, and I start doubting everything I've done to prepare. It's like this voice in my head telling me I'm not really qualified and that they're going to realize it any second. I also find it hard to think clearly, and my mind goes blank sometimes, which just makes me more anxious."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "It sounds really challenging to experience those intense physical sensations and that critical inner voice right when you need to feel most confident. How do you usually cope with these feelings and thoughts in the moment? What helps, even a little, to ground you when your mind goes blank?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "When I start feeling like that, I usually take a few deep breaths and try to remind myself that it's okay not to know everything perfectly. Sometimes I repeat a little mantra in my head, like \"I am prepared, and I can handle this.\" But honestly, it doesn't always work. The anxiety sometimes feels too strong, and I still get stuck in those negative thoughts. I also try to focus on the interviewer's face or the room around me to stay present, but it's hard to keep that up the whole time."

      "content": "It sounds like you're doing your best to manage these intense feelings with some thoughtful strategies, even though it can feel overwhelming at times.

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, when my coping techniques feel less effective, it's usually because I start overthinking the questions I got wrong in past interviews or I imagine the worst-case scenarios, like completely freezing or saying something stupid. My chest tightens, and I feel this wave of panic that just takes over. I also notice that when I focus too much on how I might be judged, I lose track of what I'm actually trying to say, and that makes me feel even more incompetent."

    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "It sounds like those moments of overthinking and imagining worst-case scenarios really amplify your anxiety and create a cycle that's hard to break.

Maybe focusing on something simple and grounding, like feeling my feet on the floor or taking slow, deep breaths, could help me bring my attention back to the present instead of spiraling into those negative thoughts. I also wish I could be kinder to myself and remember that one interview doesn't define my worth or my abilities."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I think if I could genuinely practice those reminders and be kinder to myself during an interview, it might help me feel less overwhelmed and more in control. It could take some of the pressure off and allow me to focus more on the conversation instead of my fears. To make this a natural response, maybe I could prepare by practicing these reminders regularly, even outside of interviews, so they become more familiar and automatic. It might also help if I had a small ritual before the interview, like a calming breathing exercise or repeating my mantra, to set a positive tone. Sometimes, just having someone remind me that it's okay to be imperfect and that I belong there could make a big difference too."

    },

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I think the first step could be setting aside a few minutes each day to practice my breathing exercises and repeat my mantra. Maybe I could do it in the morning or right before bed to make it a habit. It feels a little scary to think about reaching out for support because I worry that I might be bothering others or that they won't understand how I'm feeling. But at the same time, I know it could really help to have someone remind me that I'm not alone and that it's okay to feel anxious. So, I want to try being more open about it, even if it's uncomfortable at first."

      "content": "I think it would help if I start by sharing my feelings with someone I trust and who has been supportive in the past, like a close friend or a family member. Maybe if I prepare what I want to say beforehand, it won't feel so overwhelming in the moment. It might also be comforting to remind myself that the people who care about me want to help, not judge. Taking small steps, like sending a message or having a short conversation, could make it easier to open up more over time."

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I feel like preparing what I want to say could really help me organize my thoughts and reduce some of the anxiety about opening up. The most important thing for me to express is how much the anxiety affects me during interviews and that sometimes I feel like I'm not good enough, even though I know logically that isn't true. I want the person I'm talking to understand that it's not just nervousness but something deeper that's hard to shake. A supportive response for me would be someone listening without judgment, offering reassurance that my feelings are valid, and maybe sharing some encouragement or reminding me of my strengths. Just feeling heard and accepted would mean a lot."

It would make me feel less alone and more accepted, like my feelings are legitimate and that I don't have to hide them. In those moments, it might help to remind myself of past successes or positive feedback I've received, even if they feel small. Maybe keeping a list of my achievements or kind words from others could serve as a tangible reminder of my strengths when I'm struggling.

Maybe I could also write down any small victories I notice each day, like completing a task or getting positive feedback during my job search. The idea of doing this feels a bit daunting because sometimes it’s hard to believe those compliments or achievements are real, but at the same time, I feel a little hopeful that having a tangible list might help me see my worth more clearly. It feels like a small step, but also a way to fight against the negative voice that tells me I’m not good enough."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "When that negative voice tries to overshadow the reminders, I notice that I start feeling tense and a little hopeless, like the doubts are louder than the positive things I’m trying to focus on. Sometimes it feels like a tug-of-war in my mind, and I get frustrated with myself for not being able to silence the negative thoughts. To gently hold space for both feelings, I think I need to remind myself that it’s okay to have those doubts and fears—they don’t erase my strengths or achievements. I can acknowledge the anxiety and still keep trying to focus on the positive, treating myself with kindness instead of criticism. It might help to say something like, “I see you, anxiety, but I’m also seeing my worth.” That way, I’m not pushing away the difficult feelings but accepting them as part of the process."

It feels like I’m giving myself permission to be imperfect and still be worthy, which is something I really need right now.

It might also help to have a list of quick grounding techniques or comforting phrases to turn to in those moments. And reaching out to someone I trust for a little extra support or encouragement could make a big difference too. I know it won't be perfect, but just having some tools and people to lean on might help me keep that gentle mindset even when it's tough."
