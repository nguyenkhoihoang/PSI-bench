I’m good at handling details and coordinating with different teams, but my current job doesn’t really give me the chance to use those strengths fully. As for aspirations, I want a role where I feel like I’m making a meaningful contribution and where my efforts are appreciated, not just taken for granted. It’s hard because sometimes I feel like I’m not good enough or that my past mistakes mean I won’t find something better, which probably isn’t true but I can’t help fixating on those thoughts."

It makes me feel anxious and a bit hopeless, like I’m trapped in this cycle of not being good enough. I know it’s probably an exaggeration, but it’s hard to shake off. Sometimes I just feel empty and tired, like my efforts won’t ever be enough to change things."

      "content": "Honestly, sometimes I find a little relief by just taking a break, like stepping outside for some fresh air or listening to music I like. It’s not a big fix, but it helps me pause the negative thoughts for a bit. I also try to remind myself of small things I’ve done well, even if they seem minor, to counterbalance those feelings of worthlessness. But it’s tough to keep that up consistently, and I often slip back into feeling like I’m not enough or that I’m just stuck where I am."

It’s like I can see a small possibility that things might get better, and that gives me some motivation to keep trying. I also feel a bit lighter, less weighed down by all the negative thoughts. But the most challenging part about maintaining that balance is how easily the negative thoughts sneak back in and overshadow those moments. It feels like no matter how hard I try to focus on the positives, the doubts and feelings of not being enough always find a way to creep back, making it hard to stay steady."

Also, having someone to talk to regularly who understands what I’m going through might make it easier to catch those negative thoughts early and not let them take over. Sometimes I feel like I’m facing these feelings alone, and that makes them harder to manage. So, support in the form of encouragement and gentle reminders could be really valuable. It might also help to set small, achievable goals to build my confidence gradually, so I can see progress more clearly instead of feeling stuck."

Then, when I start feeling doubt, I could look back at those notes to remind myself of my strengths. For support, I think having a friend or mentor check in with me weekly to talk about how I’m doing and encourage me would be really comforting. What feels most motivating in those moments is gentle encouragement that acknowledges my efforts, even if progress is slow, and reassurance that it’s okay to have setbacks. That kind of support would help me feel less alone and more capable of facing the challenges ahead."

Maybe just a quick note on my phone or a small journal by my bedside would help make it a routine that fits into my day without feeling like a big task. It would feel more meaningful if I remind myself that even small positive moments or efforts are worth recognizing, and that it’s okay if some days I only have one thing to note. For the check-ins with a friend or mentor, I would hope they are patient, non-judgmental, and genuinely supportive. Someone who listens well and can offer encouragement without making me feel pressured or rushed. It would be nice if they also share some understanding of what I’m going through, so I don’t feel like I’m explaining everything from scratch each time. That kind of consistent, gentle support would probably help me stick with the routine and feel less alone in this process."

Maybe I could give myself permission to take it slow or even skip the journaling if I’m really struggling, without feeling like I’ve failed. It might help to have some kind of self-soothing activity or phrase I can use to ground myself and practice kindness toward myself when those tougher moments come. \n\nWhen communicating with a friend or mentor, I think it would be important to be honest about how I’m feeling and what kind of support I need, whether that’s just listening, gentle encouragement, or help refocusing on my strengths. I’d want to let them know that sometimes I might need space or patience, and that it’s helpful when they check in without pressure.

For example, if I seem anxious or down, they might encourage me to try deep breathing or softly say one of the calming phrases with me.
